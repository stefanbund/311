### Phase 2 Assignment
For Phase 2, your team will deliver one page per team member. Each team member must deliver two pages with the following features:
1. An image gallery, with captions for each image, and a description. For each image, create three arrays. Array 1 will include the image's url in S3.
Array 2 will include a title, or caption for the image. Array 3 will include a three sentence description of each image.
2. Initially, the gallery will display each image. A for loop iterates Array 1, loading the url of each image from S3. Each image must exist on the internet, on S3.
3. The image gallery must contain the caption for each image, inside a div devoted to each image. 
4. Each image should be clicked, and lead to a detail page, where the image will reappear, with the title/caption. The description will appear 
inside the detail page for the first time. 
5. Each facet of the image (url, caption, description) will come from arrays in the initial page. They will transfer to the detail page via
URL parameters. Be able to read the search property of the URL in the detail page, after it has been redirected from the image gallery, then
load the parameters and distribute those properties across your layout. 
6. Make your layout responsive, so that it loads equally well on any device. 

Submit your URL to the instructor via email, when complete.
